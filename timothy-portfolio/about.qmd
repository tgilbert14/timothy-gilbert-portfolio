Hi â€” I'm Timothy, an ecologist turned data scientist with a passion for building tools that drive conservation, clinical progress, and environmental understanding. My journey began with wildlife fieldwork and trapping grid maps and has evolved into designing clean database schemas, predictive dashboards, and QA systems that empower teams to make data-backed decisions.

I thrive at the intersection of meaningful missions and technical complexity. Whether it's wrangling messy ecological field data, designing visual workflows for conservation agencies, or exploring clinical programming standards like CDISC, Iâ€™m all in. Iâ€™ve worked with federal agencies, research institutions, and cross-functional technical teams â€” always aiming to improve clarity, utility, and insight.

I believe good data tools should be intuitive, adaptable, and human-centered. And I love the creative challenge of bridging field knowledge with analytical design. Most recently, Iâ€™ve been exploring PK/PD modeling, clinical data transformation, and Quarto-based documentation systems to support scientific transparency and reproducibility.

## ðŸŒ¿ Interests & Focus
- Ecological data pipelines and interactive tools
- R Shiny dashboards, SQL databases, and QA automation
- Visual storytelling through data (ggplot2, Quarto, Tableau)
- Mission-driven work in conservation, public health, and research
